# Weather App

This is a simple weather application built using HTML, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to search for their city's weather and get the current temperature displayed on the screen.

This project was created just for fun when I was bored in the middle of the night.

You can also use the application by visiting this link: [https://saviskar.github.io/weather-app/](https://saviskar.github.io/weather-app/)

## Features
- **City Search**: Users can type the name of their city into the search bar.
- **Real-time Weather Data**: Fetches and displays the current temperature of the entered city.
- **Responsive Design**: Styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive user interface.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the web application.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for fetching and displaying weather data.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and layout.

## How It Works
1. User enters a city name in the search bar.
2. The app fetches weather data for the specified city using a weather API.
3. The current temperature is displayed on the screen.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A text editor (e.g., VS Code).
- A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

## Customization
